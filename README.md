# ListViewWPF
Building a User Control with User Defined Order List in WPF

This user control allows the user to move the selected item up or down one position when clicking the Up or the Down button each time in order to reset the order (or preference) of the listed items. This user control implements the Click event for both the Up or the Down buttons for moving the selected item. This user control only supports single item selection.
